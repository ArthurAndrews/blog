These are the primary tools I plan to use in making this blog.

# **R** - *programming language*

[https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/)

I have used many programming languages other the years, starting with Basic on the Commodore 64!  (I was 7 years old).  C++, MATLAB, APL, and Python received the most attention.  But once I discovered R, it instantly became my favorite tool.  With the `tidyverse` set of packages, R has the absolute best API for working with data frames and SQL databases, and the `shiny`, `htmltools`, and `reactable` packages can produce really nice web apps and html content as well.

# **baseballr** - *an R interface to MLB data*

[https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/)

Major League baseball makes a lot of interesting data available through the Statcast API.  Unfortunately...public APIs can be a huge pain in the neck.  The JSON format is functional but artless.  And APIs require very precise documentation to be usable.  Luckily, `baseballr` offers a nicer interface to Statcast data and some other web-scraped databases.

# **quarto** - *publishing data-rich documents from code*

[https://quarto.org/](https://quarto.org/)

Anyone writing R or Python code should learn Quarto.  It's a rich markdown format for publishing documents, blogs, websites, dashboards, or even apps with a server back end.

# **GitHub Pages** - *hosting code and web pages*

[https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)

Part of my goal in making this blog was to improve my skills with GitHub Pages.  I'm more familiar with a competing product, GitLab Pages.  Turns out, the quarto command line interface makes publishing to GitHub pages extremely easy (`quarto publish gh-pages`), and I hardly had to learn anything at all.
